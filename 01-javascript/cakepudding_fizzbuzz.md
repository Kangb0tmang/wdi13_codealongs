Write a JavaScript function cakepudding that logs all numbers from 1 - 100 using for loops. 

- If a number is divisible by 3 log "Cake" instead of the number. 
- If a number is divisible by 5 log "Pudding" instead of the number. 
- If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "CakePudding" instead of the number.

**Modulo Operator**
In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For checking for divisibility, its a handy operator if check the output for 0.


`console.log(5 % 2)` - Will equal 1

`console.log(10 % 2)` - Will equal 0

**Steps:**

1.	setup a loop to print out numbers from 1 to 100
2.	figure out how to use modulo operator to check for divisibility
3.	print out Cake for numbers by 3
4.	print out Pudding for numbers by 5
